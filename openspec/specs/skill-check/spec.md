# skill-check Specification

## Purpose
Low-level advisory quality gate: deterministic mechanical checks plus an agent pass, reported honestly in two buckets, results in chat only.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Deterministic mechanical checks
The skill SHALL verify deterministically, driven by the structured guidance data plus workspace overrides: required sections present with canonical titles; canonical sections appearing in the declared order; exactly one methodology from the closed set with its required subsections; forbidden headings absent; the timeline section staying within its size constraint; every declared research question referenced as `(RQn)` in the methodology section; citation-key consistency in both directions (cited-but-undefined is an error, defined-but-uncited a warning); duplicate reference ids; `min_references` satisfied; leftover `[TODO: …]` markers; and file-format guardrails (blank line before the trailing metadata block, exactly one metadata block, no boolean-literal keys).

Order verification and the timeline size constraint SHALL be errors, not warnings, matching the severity of a missing section. The timeline size constraint SHALL NOT be applied when the workspace selects the detailed timeline mode.

#### Scenario: Cited key missing from references
- **WHEN** the body cites `[@Kim24]` and no reference with id `Kim24` exists
- **THEN** the check reports it as a mechanical failure with the location

#### Scenario: RQ never referenced in methodology
- **WHEN** the proposal declares RQ3 and the methodology section never contains `(RQ3)`
- **THEN** the check reports the missing cross-reference

#### Scenario: Timeline section absent
- **WHEN** a proposal carries the four research sections but no timeline section
- **THEN** the check reports a missing required section as an error

#### Scenario: Section order violated
- **WHEN** the timeline section appears before the methodology section
- **THEN** the check reports an ordering error naming the misplaced section

#### Scenario: Timeline body too rich
- **WHEN** the timeline section contains a table, a list item, a subsection, or more than three non-empty lines
- **THEN** the check reports it as an error naming what was found

#### Scenario: Detailed timeline mode selected
- **WHEN** the workspace sets the detailed timeline mode and the timeline section carries a phase table
- **THEN** the check reports no timeline size error

### Requirement: Warning-class pattern checks
The skill SHALL report as warnings (never hard failures, false positives acknowledged): first-person pronouns; three consecutive sentences starting with the same word; personal-data patterns (emails, matriculation numbers); an `author` key in the metadata block, since proposals are anonymous by default and the key is rendered verbatim on the title page; confidentiality markers in English and German ("confidential", "internal use only", "do not distribute", "NDA", "vertraulich", "nur für den internen Gebrauch"), because theses get published; author-in-text citations of references that declare neither an author nor an editor, because those render as a quoted title inside the sentence; an author surname of a cited reference typed in the prose immediately before that citation, because the typed name is a copy that stops tracking the reference entry; and a reference id that does not follow the documented key shape or reaches the documented length limit. The metadata `author` warning SHALL name the legitimate exception — a program that requires a named title page — because that exception is declared in workspace guidance prose and is therefore not machine-detectable. The skill SHALL NOT attempt to detect writer names in body prose; the typed-author-name check concerns cited authors only and SHALL be anchored to the surnames of the reference actually cited, never to a general capitalisation pattern.

#### Scenario: Confidentiality stamp
- **WHEN** the body contains "vertraulich" as a document marker
- **THEN** the check emits a warning citing the publication rationale

#### Scenario: Author-in-text citation of an authorless reference
- **WHEN** the body cites a reference author-in-text and that reference declares no author and no editor
- **THEN** the check emits a warning naming the key and the line, stating that the rendered form is the quoted title, and suggesting the bracketed form instead

#### Scenario: Author-in-text citation of an editor-only reference
- **WHEN** the body cites a reference author-in-text and that reference declares editors but no authors
- **THEN** no warning is emitted, because the rendered label uses the editor surnames

#### Scenario: Bracketed citation of an authorless reference
- **WHEN** the body cites a reference in the bracketed form and that reference declares no author
- **THEN** no warning is emitted, because no author label is rendered

#### Scenario: Metadata block declares an author
- **WHEN** the metadata block declares `author: Erika Musterfrau` or `author: [TODO: add author]`
- **THEN** the check emits a warning to remove it unless the program requires a named cover page, and the run does not fail

#### Scenario: Anonymous proposal
- **WHEN** the metadata block declares no `author` key
- **THEN** no author-key warning is emitted

#### Scenario: Author surname typed before a bracketed citation
- **WHEN** the body reads "Smith et al. [@Smith26Deep] propose a detector" and `Smith` is an author of `Smith26Deep`
- **THEN** the check emits a warning naming the key and the line and suggesting the author-in-text form, which renders the name from the entry

#### Scenario: Author surname typed before an author-in-text citation
- **WHEN** the body reads "Smith et al. @Smith26Deep propose a detector"
- **THEN** the check emits a warning, because the rendered output repeats the name

#### Scenario: Unrelated proper noun before a citation
- **WHEN** a sentence ends in a proper noun that is not an author of the cited reference, as in "deployments in Germany [@Okafor24Carbon]"
- **THEN** no warning is emitted

#### Scenario: Author-in-text form used correctly
- **WHEN** the body cites a reference author-in-text with no name typed in the prose, including the possessor form "the detector of @key"
- **THEN** no warning is emitted

#### Scenario: Surname belongs to a different reference
- **WHEN** a surname appears before a citation of a reference that person did not author
- **THEN** no warning is emitted, because the check is anchored per key

#### Scenario: Reference key carries no year

- **WHEN** a reference id reads `RiveraYearSurvey`, with the literal word "Year" where the year belongs
- **THEN** the check emits a warning naming the key and the expected shape

#### Scenario: Reference key too long

- **WHEN** a reference id reaches the documented length limit
- **THEN** the check emits a warning

#### Scenario: Unusual but well-formed key

- **WHEN** a reference id follows the documented shape, including one built from an institutional or particle-bearing author name
- **THEN** no warning is emitted

### Requirement: Title tells reported as warnings
The deterministic script SHALL inspect the metadata `title:` value and report as warnings, never as errors: an implementation-framing opener in English or German; a term from the closed buzzword list in English or German; a trailing question mark; and a word count outside the documented bounds. Each finding SHALL name the matched tell and state that the title reaches the study certificate. These findings SHALL be warnings because the patterns can fire on a legitimate title and because the script cannot judge whether a named technology is the object of study.

#### Scenario: Implementation opener
- **WHEN** the title opens with an implementation-framing phrase such as an English development opener or its German equivalent
- **THEN** the check emits a warning naming the opener and the certificate rationale, and the run does not fail on that finding

#### Scenario: Buzzword present
- **WHEN** the title carries a term from the documented buzzword list
- **THEN** the check emits a warning naming the term

#### Scenario: Question-form title
- **WHEN** the title ends in a question mark
- **THEN** the check emits a warning naming the certificate rationale

#### Scenario: Word count out of bounds
- **WHEN** the title falls below the documented minimum for the proposal's language or above the documented maximum word count
- **THEN** the check emits a warning naming the count, the bound it crossed, and the certificate rationale

#### Scenario: German title at the German minimum
- **WHEN** a `lang: de` proposal carries a compound title shorter than the English minimum but at or above the German one
- **THEN** no word-count warning is emitted

#### Scenario: Title written as a block scalar
- **WHEN** the metadata `title:` carries a YAML folded or literal block indicator and its text continues on the following lines
- **THEN** no title tell is applied, because the value the check can read is not the title

#### Scenario: Clean academic title
- **WHEN** the title names a contribution and its object within the bounds and matches no tell
- **THEN** no title warning is emitted

#### Scenario: Title findings never fail the run
- **WHEN** the only findings are title tells
- **THEN** the run reports them under warnings and exits successfully

### Requirement: Agent pass judges title quality
The agent pass SHALL judge the title against the guidance classes the patterns cannot reach — above all whether a proper noun in the title names a tool, product, vendor, or company carried as the instrument, and whether the title names a research field rather than a thesis. Where it flags the title, the skill SHALL offer between one and three abstracted alternatives and SHALL state that a named technology is acceptable only where the student can say it is the object of study. The skill SHALL report title judgement under the agent-pass bucket, never as mechanically verified.

#### Scenario: Tool name carried as instrument
- **WHEN** the title names a framework or product used to build the artefact and no pattern matched it
- **THEN** the agent pass flags it with abstracted alternatives, under the flagged-for-the-agent-pass bucket

#### Scenario: Named technology as object of study
- **WHEN** the proposal's research questions are about the named technology itself
- **THEN** the agent pass says so and does not flag the title

### Requirement: Two-bucket honest reporting
Results SHALL be presented in chat only (no file), split into "verified mechanically" and "flagged for the agent pass". The skill SHALL never claim semantic rules passed.

#### Scenario: Clean mechanical run
- **WHEN** all mechanical checks pass
- **THEN** the report states mechanical success and explicitly defers semantic quality to review

### Requirement: Advisory, not blocking
Check gates nothing hard: other skills MAY run it first and surface failures, but SHALL proceed on user confirmation.

#### Scenario: Publish despite warnings
- **WHEN** the user confirms publishing a proposal with check warnings
- **THEN** publishing proceeds

### Requirement: Agent pass for non-mechanical issues
An agent pass SHALL cover typos/grammar and content-level forbidden material that regexes cannot catch (e.g. expected results embedded in prose), and SHALL confirm that the timeline section actually states a timeframe. The timeframe judgement SHALL accept the phrasings students genuinely use — semester labels, quarters, seasons, month names in either language — rather than a fixed set of date formats, and SHALL flag a phase breakdown or Gantt chart that the mechanical guard cannot see, including one supplied as an image.

#### Scenario: Hidden expected-results paragraph
- **WHEN** a methodology paragraph asserts concrete expected outcomes
- **THEN** the agent pass flags it as forbidden content

#### Scenario: Timeline states no timeframe
- **WHEN** the timeline section is present and within its size constraint but names no start, no end, and no as-soon-as-possible statement
- **THEN** the agent pass flags it

#### Scenario: Semester phrasing accepted
- **WHEN** the timeline section reads "The thesis runs from WS 2026/27 to SoSe 2027."
- **THEN** the agent pass accepts it

#### Scenario: Gantt chart embedded as a figure
- **WHEN** the timeline section stays within three lines but embeds a Gantt chart as an image
- **THEN** the agent pass flags it as forbidden work-plan content

### Requirement: Read-only run enforced without file mutation
A check run SHALL NOT modify the proposal or any other workspace file — no fixes, no permission changes, no temporary alterations, however obvious the correction. The mechanical report SHALL include a content digest of the checked file. In a non-interactive run the skill SHALL verify the mandate by re-running the mechanical check as its final step and comparing digests; a differing digest SHALL be reported prominently as a violation. The skill SHALL NOT instruct or perform any command that mutates file permissions or content as an enforcement mechanism.

#### Scenario: Digest in the mechanical report
- **WHEN** the mechanical check runs on a proposal
- **THEN** its report contains a digest line identifying the exact file content that was checked

#### Scenario: Non-interactive run leaves the file untouched
- **WHEN** a non-interactive check run finishes and the final re-run reports the same digest as the first
- **THEN** the check reports its findings with the read-only mandate upheld

#### Scenario: File changed during a non-interactive run
- **WHEN** the final re-run reports a different digest than the first
- **THEN** the report states prominently that the file changed during the check, instead of presenting the results as a clean read-only run
