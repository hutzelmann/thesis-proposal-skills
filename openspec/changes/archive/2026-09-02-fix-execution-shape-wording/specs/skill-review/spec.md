## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Single-context execution

The review SHALL be a single-context task: one agent holding the whole proposal judges the five substance tests and every review dimension in one pass, because the verdict cites the failing tests together, findings are ordered by severity across all of them, and a research question is judged non-overlapping only relative to the others. Helper agents (subagents, workflows) SHALL NOT be part of the skill's execution. When the host nevertheless runs the task as a workflow, the skill SHALL cap it at three agents counting the reviewing agent itself: that agent is the full review, and the helpers are at most one adversarial check of its fail verdicts and one optional reading of the proposal's own references block for citation consistency, without network access. The skill SHALL NOT assign one agent per substance test, per dimension, or per research question. The SKILL.md SHALL state this shape in an `## Execution shape` section that is the first section of the body, so that it is read before a run is planned, and the whole section SHALL be pinned verbatim offline.

Whatever the host does, a helper SHALL write no file: the main agent is the only writer, and `<slug>-review.md` carries every finding regardless of how many a helper returned. A helper SHALL work from the proposal file — never a source document — with the resolved workspace `guidelines.md` override and only the guideline sections its task needs, and SHALL return a verdict per substance test it examined (decisive fail, uncertain, or pass, with one quotable finding per failed test), then at most five findings, each with severity, location, a one-sentence problem, a one-sentence suggestion and a quote of at most one sentence, location-only duplicates merged into one finding with a location list. The helper's return SHALL carry no reasoning prose, no strengths list and no restated guidelines, unless the user asks for full reasoning. Title findings, sentence-level density findings and exceeded-limit findings keep the fuller shape this specification requires and are written by the main agent.

#### Scenario: Host runs tasks as workflows by default
- **WHEN** the host's mode would orchestrate the review as a multi-agent workflow
- **THEN** the run uses at most three agents counting the reviewer, never one per test, dimension, or research question, and the review file is written by the reviewer

#### Scenario: Helper returns more than the contract allows
- **WHEN** a helper returns reasoning prose, a strengths list, or a dozen findings differing only in location
- **THEN** the main agent keeps the per-test verdicts and the merged, capped findings, discards the rest, and the review file still enumerates every finding the review itself established

#### Scenario: Helper judges against the workspace bar
- **WHEN** the workspace carries a `guidelines.md` override
- **THEN** every helper receives the resolved override with its guideline sections, so no finding is judged against the shipped defaults alone

#### Scenario: Section survives a rewrite
- **WHEN** a change rewords any part of the execution-shape section, drops its helper-contract paragraph, or moves the section below another section, without updating its pinned copy
- **THEN** the offline suite fails naming the skill and the difference
