## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Pre-publish local security gate
Before any publication of the skill set, a local security gate SHALL pass, in this order: the audit-invariant test suite, then a local run of the same skill scanner that audits the published registry entries, executed against the repository's skills staged in isolation from the developer's real agent configuration. The scanner gate SHALL fail on any finding at or above the calibrated risk threshold and SHALL report every finding with its skill, category, and reason. Publication with a failing gate requires an explicit, recorded decision.

#### Scenario: Scanner finds a high-risk pattern
- **WHEN** the local scanner reports a finding at or above the threshold for any skill
- **THEN** the gate exits non-zero, names the skill and the finding, and publication does not proceed by default

#### Scenario: Gate isolation
- **WHEN** the local scanner runs
- **THEN** it scans only the repository's skills, not the developer's installed agent configurations or MCP servers

### Requirement: Post-publish verdict confirmation
After publication, the published audit verdicts for every skill SHALL be fetched from the registry's audit API and compared against a committed baseline. A deviation SHALL be reported as a non-zero result with a per-skill, per-provider diff. The baseline SHALL be updatable only by an explicit command, so silent verdict drift — including provider-side re-scans without a new publication — is always surfaced.

#### Scenario: Provider verdict drifts
- **WHEN** a provider's verdict for any skill differs from the committed baseline
- **THEN** the comparison exits non-zero and names the skill, provider, and both verdicts

#### Scenario: Verdicts match baseline
- **WHEN** all fetched verdicts equal the baseline
- **THEN** the comparison exits zero

### Requirement: Audit-pattern regressions caught by tests
The risk patterns remediated in past audits SHALL be enforced by automated tests over the shipped skill content: no dynamic module loading from input-derived names, no credential lookup outside the documented locations, no instructions to mutate file permissions, no embedded execution of another skill's scripts, and no instructions that pass a secret value through the agent. The tests SHALL run in the default offline test suite.

#### Scenario: Remediated pattern reintroduced
- **WHEN** a change reintroduces one of the remediated patterns into a skill's shipped content
- **THEN** the offline test suite fails naming the file and the pattern
