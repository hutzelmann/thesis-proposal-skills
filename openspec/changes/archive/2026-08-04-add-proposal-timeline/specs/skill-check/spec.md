## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Deterministic mechanical checks
The skill SHALL verify deterministically, driven by the structured guidance data plus workspace overrides: required sections present with canonical titles; canonical sections appearing in the declared order; exactly one methodology from the closed set with its required subsections; forbidden headings absent; the timeline section staying within its size constraint; every declared research question referenced as `(RQn)` in the methodology section; citation-key consistency in both directions (cited-but-undefined is an error, defined-but-uncited a warning); duplicate reference ids; `min_references` satisfied; leftover `[TODO: …]` markers; and file-format guardrails (blank line before the trailing metadata block, exactly one metadata block, no boolean-literal keys).

Order verification and the timeline size constraint SHALL be errors, not warnings, matching the severity of a missing section. The timeline size constraint SHALL NOT be applied when the workspace selects the detailed timeline mode.

#### Scenario: Cited key missing from references
- **WHEN** the body cites `[@Kim24]` and no reference with id `Kim24` exists
- **THEN** the check reports it as a mechanical failure with the location

#### Scenario: RQ never referenced in methodology
- **WHEN** the proposal declares RQ3 and the methodology section never contains `(RQ3)`
- **THEN** the check reports the missing cross-reference

#### Scenario: Timeline section absent
- **WHEN** a proposal carries the four research sections but no timeline section
- **THEN** the check reports a missing required section as an error

#### Scenario: Section order violated
- **WHEN** the timeline section appears before the methodology section
- **THEN** the check reports an ordering error naming the misplaced section

#### Scenario: Timeline body too rich
- **WHEN** the timeline section contains a table, a list item, a subsection, or more than three non-empty lines
- **THEN** the check reports it as an error naming what was found

#### Scenario: Detailed timeline mode selected
- **WHEN** the workspace sets the detailed timeline mode and the timeline section carries a phase table
- **THEN** the check reports no timeline size error

### Requirement: Agent pass for non-mechanical issues
An agent pass SHALL cover typos/grammar and content-level forbidden material that regexes cannot catch (e.g. expected results embedded in prose), and SHALL confirm that the timeline section actually states a timeframe. The timeframe judgement SHALL accept the phrasings students genuinely use — semester labels, quarters, seasons, month names in either language — rather than a fixed set of date formats, and SHALL flag a phase breakdown or Gantt chart that the mechanical guard cannot see, including one supplied as an image.

#### Scenario: Hidden expected-results paragraph
- **WHEN** a methodology paragraph asserts concrete expected outcomes
- **THEN** the agent pass flags it as forbidden content

#### Scenario: Timeline states no timeframe
- **WHEN** the timeline section is present and within its size constraint but names no start, no end, and no as-soon-as-possible statement
- **THEN** the agent pass flags it

#### Scenario: Semester phrasing accepted
- **WHEN** the timeline section reads "The thesis runs from WS 2026/27 to SoSe 2027."
- **THEN** the agent pass accepts it

#### Scenario: Gantt chart embedded as a figure
- **WHEN** the timeline section stays within three lines but embeds a Gantt chart as an image
- **THEN** the agent pass flags it as forbidden work-plan content
