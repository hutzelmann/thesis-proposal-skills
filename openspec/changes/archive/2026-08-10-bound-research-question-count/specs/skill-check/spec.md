## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Deterministic mechanical checks
The skill SHALL verify deterministically, driven by the structured guidance data plus workspace overrides: required sections present with canonical titles; canonical sections appearing in the declared order; exactly one methodology from the closed set with its required subsections; forbidden headings absent; the timeline section staying within its size constraint; the number of declared research questions staying within the configured bounds; every declared research question referenced as `(RQn)` in the methodology section; citation-key consistency in both directions (cited-but-undefined is an error, defined-but-uncited a warning); duplicate reference ids; `min_references` satisfied; leftover `[TODO: …]` markers; and file-format guardrails (blank line before the trailing metadata block, exactly one metadata block, no boolean-literal keys).

Order verification, the timeline size constraint, and the research-question count bound SHALL be errors, not warnings, matching the severity of a missing section. The timeline size constraint SHALL NOT be applied when the workspace selects the detailed timeline mode.

#### Scenario: Cited key missing from references
- **WHEN** the body cites `[@Kim24]` and no reference with id `Kim24` exists
- **THEN** the check reports it as a mechanical failure with the location

#### Scenario: RQ never referenced in methodology
- **WHEN** the proposal declares RQ3 and the methodology section never contains `(RQ3)`
- **THEN** the check reports the missing cross-reference

#### Scenario: Too many research questions
- **WHEN** the proposal declares more research questions than the configured upper bound
- **THEN** the check reports an error naming the count found and the bound applied

#### Scenario: Timeline section absent
- **WHEN** a proposal carries the four research sections but no timeline section
- **THEN** the check reports a missing required section as an error

#### Scenario: Section order violated
- **WHEN** the timeline section appears before the methodology section
- **THEN** the check reports an ordering error naming the misplaced section

#### Scenario: Timeline body too rich
- **WHEN** the timeline section contains a table, a list item, a subsection, or more than three non-empty lines
- **THEN** the check reports it as an error naming what was found

#### Scenario: Detailed timeline mode selected
- **WHEN** the workspace sets the detailed timeline mode and the timeline section carries a phase table
- **THEN** the check reports no timeline size error
